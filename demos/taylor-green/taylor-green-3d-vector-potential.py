Div-conforming B-spline discretization of 3D Taylor--Green flow, following 
Section 9.11.2 of

  https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2011-12-4506/EVANS-DISSERTATION.pdf

discretizing the vector potential, instead of the velocity, i.e., we discretize
the field

  \mathbf{A} = \nabla\times\mathbf{u}

in an N-type space, instead of $\mathbf{u}$ in an RT-type space.  UFL makes 
this especially straightforward.  The viscous terms are therefore
fourth-order, which is why this formulation has not been widely-used
with traditional finite elements.  (A related formulation is the 
streamfunction--vorticity formulation sometimes applied in 2D, where only one
component of the vector potential (i.e., the scalar streamfunction) is 
nonzero, and viscous terms are handled by solving for an extra vorticity 
field.)

Geometry is described for this problem using an explicit B-spline.

Note: Due to the algebraic complexity added by the curl operations to
convert vector potentials to velocities in this formulation, the form 
compilation in this example takes *much* longer than it does for typical 
problems. 

Note: Due to the use of explicit B-splines, more efficient assembly is possible
by neglecting pushforwards and geometrical mappings.  However, the purpose
of this demo is primarily didactic, so the unnecessary algebra is included.
