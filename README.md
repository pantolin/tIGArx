# tIGArx

A Python library for isogeometric analysis (IGA) using FEniCS.  The following article outlines the design of tIGArx:

## Dependencies
* Any meaningful usage requires [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) (version 2019.1) and its dependencies.
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) is required.  (SciPy is already included in FEniCS Docker distributions.)
* Usage of the NURBS module requires [igakit](https://github.com/dalcinl/igakit).
* Compiling the API documentation requires [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
* The most convenient program for visualizing results is [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/).

## Installation

Install all dependencies, clone the repository (or download and extract from an archive), and append the top-level directory of the repository (viz. the one with subdirectories `tIGArx`, `docs`, etc.) to the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`, e.g., by adding
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/repository/:$PYTHONPATH
```
to your `~/.bashrc` file (and `source`-ing it).  To (optionally) build the API documentation, change directory to `docs` and type `make html`. The main documentation will then be in `./_build/html/index.html`, which can be opened with a web browser.  

### On clusters
The most convenient way to use FEniCS (and therefore tIGArx) on HPC clusters is via [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/).  A singularity recipe for using tIGArx is in the file `singularity-recipe.def`.  Some additional notes are provided in the comments of that file.  

### Common installation issues
* `petsc4py.PETSc.Mat object has no attribute PtAP`: This is due to an old version of `petsc4py`.  Try installing the latest version via `pip3`.
* `ImportError: No module named dolfin`: This occurs when attempting to use `python` rather than `python3`.  FEniCS 2018.1 and newer no longer support Python 2.
* `Python.h: No such file or directory`: This requires installing the header files for the Python C API.  On Ubuntu, these can be installed via `sudo apt-get install python3-dev`.
* `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scipy._lib.decorator'`: Try re-installing SciPy, which can be done with the command `pip3 install --force-reinstall scipy`.
* Errors due to old versions of FEniCS: Run `dolfin-version` in a terminal to check your version of FEniCS.  Note in particular that Ubuntu PPAs for the current stable version of FEniCS are only maintained for the most recent few Ubuntu releases.  Installing via the package manager on an old Ubuntu release may install an older version of FEniCS.
* `libgfortran.so.3 cannot be found`, or other issues with `libgfortran` when using the Singularity container: Try adding `apt-get -y install libgfortran3` under the `%post` section in the file `singularity-recipe.def`.
