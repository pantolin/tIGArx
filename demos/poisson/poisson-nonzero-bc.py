"""
The linear algebra operations in tIGAr only directly support homogeneous (zero)
Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs), but this is sufficient to implement
inhomogeneous (nonzero) BCs relatively easily. This demo modifies the basic
Poisson equation example to enforce inhomogeneous Dirichlet BCs.

    # as our solution. We could project any function that satisfies the
    # BC, but we use a projection of the exact solution here because it is
    # available here. By default, the projection is done in an $L^2$ sense,

    # nonlinear problem. This will converge in a single iteration, due to
    # the linearity of the problem. The zero BC set earlier will be enforced
    # by default on each increment of the nonlinear solve.
