####### Notes #######
#
# This is a Singularity recipe that adds TSFC, tIGArx, and igakit to a
# Docker container with the current stable version of FEniCS.  (TSFC is not
# strictly required for tIGArx, but may be useful for some complicated
# variational forms.)
#
# To build an image from this recipe, use the following command (on a
# system where you have sudo access):
#
# $ sudo singularity build image.simg singularity-recipe.def
#
# "image.simg" may be replaced with the desired file name for the image.
# This image will be usable with later versions of singularity, but is NOT
# necessarily backwards-compatible with earlier versions.  
#
# On some systems, it may be necessary to mount a custom home
# directory at runtime (with the -H option), to avoid conficts with
# software installed in your home directory (which is mounted by default).
